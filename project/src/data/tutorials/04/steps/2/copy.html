<h2>True or false?</h2>

<p>In fact, we can be even more efficient. The condition in a conditional section doesn't have to be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> &ndash; instead it is evaluated as <em>truthy</em> or <em>falsy</em>.</p>

<p>Let's stipulate that the <code>user</code> property only exists if a user is signed in, and that if they are signed in, <code>user</code> is an object with a <code>name</code> property.</p>

<p>Edit the sign-in code accordingly:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
ractive.on( 'signIn', function () {
  var name = prompt( 'Enter your username to sign in', 'ractive_fan' );
  ractive.set( 'user.name', name );
});
</pre>

<div class='hint'>
	<p>Here, we're setting a property on an object that doesn't exist yet. That's fine &ndash; <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> will create the object. If we'd done <code>ractive.set( 'user[0]', name )</code> or <code>ractive.set( 'user.0', name )</code> it would assume we wanted to create an array instead of an object.</p>
</div>

<p>Initially, <code>user</code> will be <code>undefined</code>, but once someone signs in, <code>user</code> will be an object. Since <code>undefined</code> is falsy and objects are always truthy, we can use <code>user</code> instead of <code>signedIn</code>.</p>

<p>Update the template accordingly, discarding <code>signedIn</code> in favour of <code>user</code>. Notice that <code>{{#user}}</code> isn't just a conditional section any more &ndash; it's also a <em>context section</em>. So we can use the <code>{{name}}</code> property in our 'welcome back!' message.</p>

<p>Execute the code.</p>

<div class='hint'>
	<p>In JavaScript, the following values are falsy: <code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>NaN</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>""</code> (the empty string), and <code>false</code>.</p>

	<p>However in mustache, there is a special case &ndash; arrays with a length of 0 are treated as falsy. This will make sense when we tackle list sections in the next tutorial.</p>
</div>
